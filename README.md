## Projects

### Market Basket Analysis: 

- Increase sales by customizing product proposals for each customer... and increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty in the meantime.
- Optimize location of items in store, create smarter product promotion campaigns, learn from hidden buying patters from customers

### How to segment market data for unknown data:

- This is also a good way to boost ideas for known data as well.

### Pricing-elasticity: 

- Better price decisions, considering effect of changes in demand and price among several SKUs.

### Maximizing profit in a dairy factory.

Showing data for ideas related to Product Management:

* Which products deliver more profit?
* Is manpower a bottleneck for further profit generation?
* Which ingredients are a bottleneck?
* How would profit look like removing ingredient bottlenecks?

This solution has used free software and libraries, and can also be used with licensed software, like Gurobi.

### Forecasting using statistical models: 

- "Predict the future" to prepare yourself now: demand, production availability, new product launch, competitor's activities, marketing campaigns...
- Give it a try to statistical models:
  - Easy to model
  - Fast to run
  - Good explainability
  - Actually useful for many problems

### Maximizing profit in a dairy factory.

Showing data for ideas related to Product Management:

* Which products deliver more profit?
* Is manpower a bottleneck for further profit generation?
* Which ingredients are a bottleneck?
* How would profit look like removing ingredient bottlenecks?

This solution has used free software and libraries, and can also be used with licensed software, like Gurobi.

### Forecasting using statistical models: 

- "Predict the future" to prepare yourself now: demand, production availability, new product launch, competitor's activities, marketing campaigns...
- Give it a try to statistical models:
  - Easy to model
  - Fast to run
  - Good explainability
  - Actually useful for many problems
